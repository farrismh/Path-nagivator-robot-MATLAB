## Path-Navigator-Robot
With this project, I demonstrate how to compute an obstacle-free path between two locations on a given
map using the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) path planner. PRM path planner constructs a roadmap in
the free space of a given map using randomly sampled nodes in the free space and connecting them
with each other. Once the roadmap has been constructed, you can query for a path from a given start location to a given end location on the map.

(*Important* - Please make sure you have **Robotics System Toolbox** Add-On installed for your MATLAB)

The following project has been executed in **MATLAB R2021a** version
